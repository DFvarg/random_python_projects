The Collatz Conjecture is an unproved mathematical problem which states that any number will reach one if you follow two basic rules:
1. If the number is even - divide by 2
2. If the number is odd - multiply by three and add one
Then repeat until you reach one.

This is a basic python program to find the steps required on any input number.
